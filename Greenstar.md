# Demo Email

Dear _name_,


My name is Oliver Terrell and my team and I build custom software tools for wealth managers. We aim to build a package for you that will save you money while giving you with the exact tools you and your team need to be successful.

We were able to cut operational costs for the last client we worked with by $2,500/yr with a quick turnaround on specifics he wanted to see in his software. I have attached a demo report from our proprietary report generator, the format and content of which was tailored to the client’s specific wishes.

In working with us, you will have access to my business partner and I’s personal cell phone lines which you will be free to call at any time of day, any day of the week. We are here for you.

If you have a moment to respond to this email, we can set aside some time to talk about what current softwares you are using, what you do and don’t like about them, and how Greenstar may be able to help.


Thank you and have a wonderful day.
