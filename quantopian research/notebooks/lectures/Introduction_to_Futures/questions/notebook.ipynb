    "In 2016, a corn farmer decided to sell his corn at the spot price to a distributor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide whether his decision to sell corn at the spot price was a wise one by comparing his profits from the market contract with his potential profits from the futures contract.\n",

    "You may also assume the following:\n",
    "- The producer plans on selling 15,000 bushels of corn in September 2016\n",
    "- The farmer would enter into a futures position on June 1st\n",
    "- The spot price sale would take place on the same date that the futures contract expires\n",
    "- No fees or payments are included in the futures sale or the market sale\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that the listed futures price of corn is for one bushel.)"
