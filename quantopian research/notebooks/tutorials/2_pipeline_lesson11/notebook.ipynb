    "##Putting It All Together\n",
    "Now that we've covered the basic components of the Pipeline API, let's construct a pipeline that we might want to use in an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's first create a filter to narrow down the types of securities coming out of our pipeline. In this example, we will create a filter to select for securities that meet all of the following criteria:\n",
    "- Is a primary share\n",
    "- Is listed as a common stock\n",
    "- Is not a [depositary receipt](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) (ADR/GDR)\n",
    "- Is not trading [over-the-counter](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC)\n",
    "- Is not [when-issued](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wi.asp) (WI)\n",
    "- Doesn't have a name indicating it's a [limited partnership](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitedpartnership.asp) (LP)\n",
    "- Doesn't have a company reference entry indicating it's a LP\n",
    "- Is not an [ETF](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (has Morningstar fundamental data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####Why These Criteria?\n",
    "Selecting for primary shares and common stock helps us to select only a single security for each company. In general, primary shares are a good representative asset of a company so we will select for these in our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADRs and GDRs are issuances in the US equity market for stocks that trade on other exchanges. Frequently, there is inherent risk associated with depositary receipts due to currency fluctuations so we exclude them from our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "OTC, WI, and LP securities are not tradeable with most brokers. As a result, we exclude them from our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Creating Our Pipeline\n",
    "Let's create a filter for each criterion and combine them together to create a `tradeable_stocks` filter. First, we need to import the Morningstar `DataSet` as well as the `IsPrimaryShare` builtin filter."

The QTradableStocksUS is a built-in pipeline filter that selects a daily universe of stocks that are filtered in three passes and adhere to a set of criteria to yield the most liquid universe possible without any size constraints. The QTradableStocksUS therefore has no size cutoff unlike its predecessors, the [Q500US](https://www.quantopian.com/help#quantopian_pipeline_filters_Q500US) and the [Q1500US](https://www.quantopian.com/help#quantopian_pipeline_filters_Q1500US).
