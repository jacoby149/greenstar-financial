    "\n",
    "1. Express an alpha factor and define a trading universe by creating and running a Pipeline over a certain time period.\n",
    "2. Query pricing data for the assets in our universe during that same time period with `get_pricing()`.\n",
    "3. Align the alpha factor data with the pricing data with `get_clean_factor_and_forward_returns()`.\n",
    "4. Visualize how well our alpha factor predicts future price movements with `create_full_tear_sheet()`."
