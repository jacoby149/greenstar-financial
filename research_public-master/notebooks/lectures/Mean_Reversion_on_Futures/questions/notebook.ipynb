    "This lecture corresponds to the Mean Reversion on Futures lecture, which is part of the Quantopian lecture series. This homework expects you to rely heavily on the code presented in the corresponding lecture. Please copy and paste regularly from that lecture when starting to work on the problems, as trying to do them from scratch will likely be too difficult.\n",
