This is really cool.
1. Get it working easy locally.
    - Remove SQL from it
    - Remove the login functionality, 
    - Remove wealth manager account functionality
    - Just go straight the to the portfolio balancing page.
2. It would be cool to do it with custom assets.
    - Remove the 18 assets menu.
    - Instead have an appendable removable list. 
    - + button lets you add ticker, min alloc. , and max alloc.
    - Save / Delete portfolios using web10 for data.
3. Add Alpaca API
    - Use the Alpaca API instead of Yahoo Finance for the data.
    - Make a button to load in your current portfolio from Alpaca to compare against.
    - Button to trigger Alpaca API to rebalance your portfolio automatically.
    - Make it so rebalancing is only possible if you have reviewed and approve the rebalance.
4. Redirect the CRM functionality to crm.web10.app...
